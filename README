This is code I developed during my graduation and while I was learning C++ by
myself.
It works but isn't any sort of code that I'm proud of today. I decided to push
it in here anyway as it is. I might do some housekeeping on it and do some
documentation as I recognize it's quite messy but I don't plan to add new
features to it.
